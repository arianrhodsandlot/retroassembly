<!--
Before you create a new issue, please make sure that you are reporting a real bug related to RetroAssembly, not a bug regarding emulators (which should be reported to upstream repositories)
For feature requests or suggestions, its recommended to create a discussion instead though this is not mandatory. Visit https://github.com/arianrhodsandlot/retroassembly/discussions/new?category=ideas to create a discussion.

1. Use clear, descriptive titles for your posts. Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.
2. When reporting issues, please provide:
    - What you expected vs. what actually happened
    - Whether the issue happens consistently or intermittently
    - The exact steps that led to the issue
    - Your OS, browser version, if you think they are relevant to the issue.
    - Screenshots, screen recordings, or error logs when possible. Ideally, include the browser's address bar and the open browser developer tools when taking screenshots or screen recordings.
3. Do not discuss, request, or provide links to pirated, cracked, or illegally obtained software
